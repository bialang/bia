\section{Motivation}
I originally created Bia as a scripting language for server side rendering, because I did not want to use PHP. After the years Bia evolved from a dynamic, weakly typed scripting language to a static, strongly typed programming language. The main focus was always to be able to embed Bia into a C++ program easily.

\section{Structure}
Bia is currently a statically and strongly typed language. Additionally a garbage collector handles the memory.
